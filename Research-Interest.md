# Research Interests

Welcome to my research page! Here you can find an overview of the topics and areas I am passionate about.

## Areas of Focus

### Tensors Decomposition
<!-- this is how markdown writes comments -->

- Orthogonal Decomposition of Vector Spaces/Modules
- Derivation Algebras of Tensors
For my work, I look at tensors as multilinear maps. 

### Hypergraphs

- Adjacency Tensors of Hypergraphs
- Global Structure

An application of my work on tensor decomposition is in studying adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. While traditional methods utilize an extension of spectral theory to multilinear functions, I am instead leveraging the use of endomorphisms on the vector spaces over which these tensors are defined.
